# Pro-Reliability-Rollbear
A probability reliability algorithm model is established to predict fatigue life by using the Monte Carlo sampling method in MATLAB.
A probabilistic life prediction model based on small sample failure data augmentation is proposed to address the issues of limited historical failure data, discretization of life data, and uncertainty in operating environment factors of non-standard rolling bearings in large and complex equipment. Firstly, the Bootstrap method is used to expand the small sample failure data, and the maximum likelihood estimation method is applied to perform Weibull distribution dual parameter estimation on the expanded data. This allows for the solution of the basic rated life based on the small sample failure data under various reliability levels. Next, a probability reliability algorithm model is established to predict fatigue life by using the Monte Carlo sampling method and the stress intensity interference model.
